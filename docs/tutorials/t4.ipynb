    "\n",
    "Agents in Covasim are contained in an object called `People`, which contains all of the agents' properties, as well as methods for changing them from one state to another (e.g., from susceptible to infected).\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents interact with each other via one or more *contact layers*. You can think of each agent as a node in a mathematical graph, and each connection as an edge. By default, Covasim creates a single random contact network where each agent is connected to 20 other agents, completely at random. However, this is not a very realistic representation of households, workplaces, schools, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For greater realism, Covasim also comes with a \"hybrid\" population option, which provides a more realism while still being fast to generate. (It's called \"hybrid\" because it's a combination of the random network and the [SynthPops](http://synthpops.org) network, described in Tutorial 9, which is much more realistic but requires a lot of data and is computationally intensive.) The hybrid option provides four *contact layers*: households `'h'`, schools `'s'`, workplaces `'w'`, and community interactions `'c'`. Each layer is defined by (a) which agents are connected to which other agents, and (b) the weight of each connection (i.e., transmission probability). Specifically:\n",
    "* Households are small clusters, usually 2-5 people (depending on country), consisting of a wide variety of ages; this setting has high transmission probability\n",
    "* Schools are split into classrooms, usually about 20 students each, of students aged 6–22; this setting has medium transmission probability\n",
    "* Workplaces are clusters of about 5-20 people, aged (approximately) 22-65; this setting has medium transmission probability\n",
    "* Community contacts (representing parks, restaurants, transport, places of worship, etc.) are estimated as 20 random contacts per day; this setting has low transmission probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for most countries, you can load default data (age distribution and household size, both from the UN) by using the `location` keyword when creating a sim. For example, to create a realistic (i.e. hybrid) population 10,000 people for Bangladesh and plot the results, you would do:"
