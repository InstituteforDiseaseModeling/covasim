    "* By default, interventions are shown with vertical dashed lines. You can turn this off by passing `do_plot=False` to the intervention.\n",
    "* Look at the new infections plot (middle) for the clearest illustration of the impact the intervention has.\n",
    "* Note that like other \"parameters\", you can either pass interventions to the sim directly or as part of the pars dictionary; the examples below illustrate these options.\n",
    "* All interventions handle dates automatically, so days can be specified as strings, integer numbers of days from the start of the sim, or datetime objects. You can even mix and match (e.g. `days=[10, '2020-05-05']`), although this is not recommended for obvious reasons!\n",
    "\n",
    "If your simulation has different layers (discussed in Tutorial 1), you can also define the beta change to only apply to a single layer. For example, an intervention that closed 90% of schools (`'s'`) on September 1st would be written as:\n",
    "\n",

    "close_schools = cv.change_beta(days='2020-09-01', changes=0.1, layers='s')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"clip edges\" intervention works similarly to the \"change beta\" intervention, with two important distinctions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Whereas beta changes affect the per-contact transmission probability, clip edges change the number of contacts. For example, in the `close_schools` example above, each school-aged child has an unchanged number of contacts (about 20), but 10 times lower probability of infection per contact (about 0.1% per contact per day). If clip edges were used instead, then each child would have unchanged probability of infection per contact (about 1% per contact per day), but 10 times fewer contacts (about 2).\n",
    "2. While beta changes can be any value (greater or less than 1), as the name implies, clip edges can only *clip* edges, not create new ones. Edges that are clipped are saved and can later be restored, but you can never have a change of greater than 1.0 with clip edges."

    "Typically, if you have actual data on number of tests, you would use `test_num`; otherwise, you would usually use `test_prob`. For `test_num`, other than the number of tests performed, the main parameter is `symp_prob`, which determines how much more likely someone with (true positive) COVID symptoms is to test than a person who is asymptomatic or uninfected. Higher values of `symp_prob` give more diagnoses per number of tests, since symptomatic people preferentially test. The default value is 100, meaning that on any given day, a person experiencing COVID symptoms is 100 times more likely to test than someone who isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, `test_prob` also lets you specify the (daily) probability of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic testing. Unlike `test_num`, however, the total number of tests is determined by these probabilities. For example, since symptomatic testing probabilities are usually much higher than asymptomatic, if the epidemic is growing, more people will be symptomatic and thus go to be tested."

    "- `__init__()` just does what init always does; it's needed to create the class instance. For interventions, it's usually used to store keyword arguments and perform some basic initialization (the first two lines).\n",
    "- `initialize()` is similar to init, with the difference that it's invoked when the *sim* itself is initialized. It receives the sim as an input argument. This means you can use it to do a fairly powerful things. Here, since `sim.people` already exists, we can calculate up-front who the elderly are so we don't have to do it on every timestep.\n",
    "- `apply()` is the crux of the intervention. It's run on every timestep of the model, and also receives `sim` as an input. You almost always use `sim.t` to get the current timestep, here to turn the intervention on and off. But as this example shows, its real power is that it can make direct modifications to the sim itself (`sim.people.rel_sus[self.elderly] = self.rel_sus`). It can also perform calculations and store data in itself, as shown here with `self.exposed` (although in general, analyzers are better for this, since they happen at the end of the timestep, while interventions happen in the middle).\n",
    "- `plot()` is a custom method that shows a plot of the data gathered during the sim. Again, it's usually better to use analyzers for this, but for something simple like this it's fine to double-dip and use an intervention.\n",
