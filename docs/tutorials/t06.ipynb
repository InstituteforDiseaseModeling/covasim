    "# T6 - Using analyzers\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzers are objects that do not change the behavior of a simulation, but just report on its internal state, almost always something to do with `sim.people`. This tutorial takes you through some of the built-in analyzers and gives a brief example of how to build your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Age histograms and snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "Age histograms and snapshots both take \"pictures\" of the `sim.people` object at specified points in time. This is because while most of the information from `sim.people` is retrievable at the end of the sim from the stored events, it's much easier to see what's going on at the time. While the snapshot literally just makes a copy of the people object, the age histogram calculates results for different age bins:"
