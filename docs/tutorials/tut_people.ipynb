    "\n",
    "Covasim is intentionally designed to be flexible with data requirements, acknowledging that some settings have large amounts of data, while others have very little. There are, however, some minimum data requirements if a real-world context is being modeled (as opposed to a theoretical exploration). These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Population size:** To interpret results correctly, you need to know what the correct denominator is. Typically this is the city or country you're modeling, but sometimes it's not as simple as it may seem, especially early in an epidemic when cases tend to be concentrated near the source of the outbreak.\n",
    "- **Deaths per day:** Often considered to be the most reliable source of data, since deaths tend to be under-reported less than infections; however, significant under-reporting can still occur, so always treat reported deaths as the *lower* limit of the true value.\n",
    "- **Diagnosed cases per day:** Diagnosed cases are the most responsive measure of the epidemic conditions; however, they are dependent on both the number of infections and the testing rate. In settings with low or highly variable rates of testing, they may not be especially reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these essential data requirements, several other pieces of data are useful to have. These are:\n",
    "- **Seroprevalence:** Although seroprevalence rates wane over time, they are generally a more reliable indicator of total infections than diagnosed cases.\n",
    "- **Tests per day:** The number of tests can be used directly in the `test_num` intervention (see tutorial 5), and is very useful for interpreting diagnoses data.\n",
    "- **Vaccinations per day:** In locations with high vaccination rates, understanding when the vaccines were rolled out (and with which vaccines) is important for estimating current immunity levels.\n",
    "- **Policy interventions:** While changes in transmission can often be seen directly in the data on cases and deaths, at minimum it is a useful sanity check to see if these changes line up with changes in policy such as mobility restrictions or mask mandates."

    "Agents in Covasim are contained in an object called `People`, which contains all of the agents' properties, as well as methods for changing them from one state to another (e.g., from susceptible to infected).\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents interact with each other via one or more *contact layers*. You can think of each agent as a node in a mathematical graph, and each connection as an edge. By default, Covasim creates a single random contact network where each agent is connected to 20 other agents, completely at random. However, this is not a very realistic representation of households, workplaces, schools, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For greater realism, Covasim also comes with a \"hybrid\" population option, which provides a more realism while still being fast to generate. (It's called \"hybrid\" because it's a combination of the random network and the [SynthPops](http://synthpops.org) network, described in Tutorial 9, which is much more realistic but requires a lot of data and is computationally intensive.) The hybrid option provides four *contact layers*: households `'h'`, schools `'s'`, workplaces `'w'`, and community interactions `'c'`. Each layer is defined by (a) which agents are connected to which other agents, and (b) the weight of each connection (i.e., transmission probability). Specifically:\n",
    "* Households are small clusters, usually 2-5 people (depending on country), consisting of a wide variety of ages; this setting has high transmission probability\n",
    "* Schools are split into classrooms, usually about 20 students each, of students aged 6–22; this setting has medium transmission probability\n",
    "* Workplaces are clusters of about 5-20 people, aged (approximately) 22-65; this setting has medium transmission probability\n",
    "* Community contacts (representing parks, restaurants, transport, places of worship, etc.) are estimated as 20 random contacts per day; this setting has low transmission probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for most countries, you can load default data (age distribution and household size, both from the UN) by using the `location` keyword when creating a sim. For example, to create a realistic (i.e. hybrid) population 10,000 people for Bangladesh and plot the results, you would do:"
