    "## Using waning immunity\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, infection is assumed to confer lifelong perfect immunity, meaning that people who have been infected cannot be infected again.\n",
    "However, this can be changed by setting `use_waning=True` when initializing a simulation.\n",
    "When `use_waning` is set to True, agents in the simulation are assigned an initial level of neutralizing antibodies after recovering from an infection, drawn from a distribution defined in the parameter dictionary.\n",
    "This level decays over time, leading to declines in the efficacy of protection against infection, symptoms, and severe symptoms.\n",
    "The following example creates simulations without waning immunity (the default), and compares it to simulations with different speeds of immunity waning."
