    "By default, infection is assumed to confer lifelong perfect immunity, meaning that people who have been infected cannot be infected again.\n",
    "However, this can be changed by setting `use_waning=True` when initializing a simulation.\n",

    "This level decays over time, leading to declines in the efficacy of protection against infection, symptoms, and severe symptoms.\n",

This function could also incorporate steps such as randomizing the order of people within priority groups, or removing some people from the sequence to account for vaccine hesitancy and peak coverage not reaching 100%.
