Covasim docs
====================

This folder includes code for building the docs. Users are unlikely to need to
do this themselves.

To build the docs, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure dependencies are installed::

        > pip install -r requirements.txt

2.  Make the documents; there are many build options, but most convenient is::

        > make dirhtml

3.  The built documents will be in `./_build/html`.
