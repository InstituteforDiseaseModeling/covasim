Parameters
==========

This file describes the expected behavior of each parameter in the model. Note: the term "overall infection rate" can be explored using ``sim.results['doubling_time']`` and ``sim.results['r_eff']`` (a higher infection rate means lower doubling times and higher *R\_eff*), as well as by simply looking at the epidemic curves.

Population parameters
=====================

* ``pop_scale``    = Multiplicative scale for results. Test: run 2 sims, set to 10, ``sim.results['cum_exposed']`` in 2nd sim should be 10x higher than first.
* ``pop_size``     = Nmber of people in the simulation. Test: ``len(sim.people)`` should equal this number.
* ``pop_infected`` = Initial number of people infected. Test: if 0, there should be no infections; if equals ``n``, should be no *new* infections.
* ``pop_type``   = The type of population structure to use with the model; default ``'random'``, using Seattle demographics; other options are ``'hybrid'`` (structured households and random school, work, and community contacts), ``'clustered'`` (all clustered contacts), and ``'synthpops'`` (requires the ``synthpops`` library, but uses data-based population structure)
* ``location``   = Which country or state to load demographic data from (optional)

Simulation parameters
=====================

* ``start_day``    = The calendar date of the start day of the simulation.
* ``n_days``       = The number of days to simulate. Test: ``len(sim.results['t.values'])`` should equal this.
* ``rand_seed``    = Random seed for the simulation. Test: two simulations with the same seed should produce identical results *except for* person UIDs; otherwise, different.
* ``verbose``      = Level of detail to print (no test).

Disease transmission parameters
===============================

* ``n_imports``    = Average daily number of imported cases (actual number is drawn from Poisson distribution)
* ``beta``         = Transmissibility per contact. Test: set to 0 for no infections, set to 1 for â‰ˆ ``contacts`` infections per day (will not be exactly equal due to overlap and other effects)
* ``asymp_factor`` = Effect of asymptomaticity on transmission.
* ``diag_factor``  = Effect of diagnosis on transmission.
* ``cont_factor``  = Effect of being a known contact  on transmission.
* ``contacts``     = The number of contacts per layer
* ``beta_layers``  = Transmissibility per layer

Duration parameters
===================

* ``exp2inf``  = Duration from exposed to infectious
* ``inf2sym``  = Duration from infectious to symptomatic
* ``sym2sev``  = Duration from symptomatic to severe symptoms
* ``sev2crit`` = Duration from severe symptoms to requiring ICU
* ``asym2rec`` = Duration for asymptomatics to recover
* ``mild2rec`` = Duration from mild symptoms to recovered
* ``sev2rec``  = Duration from severe symptoms to recovered
* ``crit2rec`` = Duration from critical symptoms to recovered
* ``crit2die`` = Duration from critical symptoms to death

Severity parameters: Probabilities of symptom progression
=========================================================

* ``OR_no_treat``      = Odds ratio for how much more likely people are to die if no treatment available
* ``rel_symp_probs``   = Relative probability of developing symptoms
* ``rel_severe_probs`` = Relative probability of developing severe symptoms
* ``rel_crit_probs``   = Relative probability of developing critical symptoms
* ``rel_death_probs``  = Relative probability of dying
* ``prog_by_age``      = Whether to set disease progression based on the person's age
* ``prognoses``        = The full arrays of a person's prognosis (populated later by default)

Events and interventions
========================

* ``interventions`` = List of Intervention instances
* ``interv_func``   = Custom intervention function
* ``timelimit``     = Stop simulation if it exceeds this duration. Test: set to a small number (e.g. 1) and choose a large ``n``/``n_days``.
* ``stopping_func`` = User-defined stopping function (no test).

Health system parameters
========================

* ``n_beds`` = Baseline assumption is that there's enough beds for the whole population (i.e., no constraints)
