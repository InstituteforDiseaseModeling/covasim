    Isolate contacts by removing them from the simulation. Contacts are treated as

    This intervention has quite similar effects as change_beta(), but is more appropriate
    for modeling the effects of mobility reductions such as school and workplace
    closures. The main difference is that since clip_edges() actually removes contacts,
    it affects the number of people who would be traced and placed in quarantine
    if an individual tests positive. It also alters the structure of the network
    -- i.e., compared to a baseline case of 20 contacts and a 2% chance of infecting
    each, there are slightly different statistics for a beta reduction (i.e., 20 contacts
    and a 1% chance of infecting each) versus an edge clipping (i.e., 10 contacts
    and a 2% chance of infecting each).

class BaseVaccination(Intervention):
    '''
    Apply a vaccine to a subset of the population.

    This base class implements the mechanism of vaccinating people to modify their immunity.
    It does not implement allocation of the vaccines, which is implemented by derived classes
    such as `cv.vaccinate`. The idea is that vaccination involves a series of standard operations
    to modify `cv.People` and applications will likely need to modify the vaccine parameters and
    test potentially complex allocation strategies. These should be accounted for by:

        - Custom vaccine parameters being passed in as a dictionary to the vaccine intervention
        - Custom vaccine allocations being implemented by a derived class overloading
          `BaseVaccination.select_people`. Any additional attributes required to manage the allocation
          can be defined in the derived class. Refer to `cv.vaccinate` or `cv.vaccinate_sequential` for
          an example of how to implement this.

    Some quantities are tracked during execution for reporting after running the simulation.
    These are:

        - ``doses``:             the number of vaccine doses per person
        - ``vaccination_dates``: integer; dates of all doses for this vaccine

    Args:
        vaccine (dict/str) : which vaccine to use; see below for dict parameters
        label   (str)      : if vaccine is supplied as a dict, the name of the vaccine
        booster (boolean)  : whether the vaccine is a booster, i.e. whether vaccinated people are eligible
        kwargs  (dict)     : passed to Intervention()

    If ``vaccine`` is supplied as a dictionary, it must have the following parameters:

        EITHER
        - ``nab_init``:  the initial antibody level (higher = more protection)
        - ``nab_boost``: how much of a boost being vaccinated on top of a previous dose or natural infection provides
        OR
        - ``target_eff``: the target efficacy from which to calculate initial antibody and boosting.
        must be supplied as a list, where length of list is equal to number of doses
        - ``nab_eff``:   the waning efficacy of neutralizing antibodies at preventing infection
        - ``doses``:     the number of doses required to be fully vaccinated with this vaccine
        - ``interval``:  the interval between doses (integer)
        - entries for efficacy against each of the variants (e.g. ``b117``)

    See ``parameters.py`` for additional examples of these parameters.

        pim2 = cv.prior_immunity(120, 0.05)

class historical_vaccinate_prob(BaseVaccination):
    '''
    Probability-based historical vaccination

    This vaccine intervention allocates vaccines parametrized by the daily probability
    of being vaccinated.  Unlike cv.vaccinate_prob this function allows vaccination
    prior to t=0 (and continuing into the simulation).

    If any people are infected at the t=0 timestep (e.g. seed infections), this
    finds those people and will re-infect  them at the end of the historical vaccination.
    Thus you may have breakthrough infections and this might affect other interventions
    to initialize a population.

    Args:
        vaccine    (dict/str)  : which vaccine to use; see below for dict parameters
        label      (str)       : if vaccine is supplied as a dict, the name of the vaccine
        days       (int/arr)   : the day or array of days to apply the interventions
        prob       (float)     : probability of being vaccinated (i.e., fraction of the population)
        subtarget  (dict)      : subtarget intervention to people with particular indices (see test_num() for details)
        compliance (float/arr) : compliance of the person to take each dose (if scalar then applied per dose)
        kwargs     (dict)      : passed to Intervention()

    If ``vaccine`` is supplied as a dictionary, it must have the following parameters:

        - ``nab_eff``:   the waning efficacy of neutralizing antibodies at preventing infection
        - ``nab_init``:  the initial antibody level (higher = more protection)
        - ``nab_boost``: how much of a boost being vaccinated on top of a previous dose or natural infection provides
        - ``doses``:     the number of doses required to be fully vaccinated
        - ``interval``:  the interval between doses
        - entries for efficacy against each of the strains (e.g. ``b117``)

    See ``parameters.py`` for additional examples of these parameters.

    **Example**::

        pfizer = cv.historical_vaccinate_prob(vaccine='pfizer', days=np.arange(-30,0), prob=0.007) # 30-day vaccination campaign
