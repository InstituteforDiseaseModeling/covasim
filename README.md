# Covasim

Covasim is a stochastic agent-based simulator designed to be used for COVID-19
(novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2) epidemic analyses. These include projections of
indicators such as numbers of infections and peak hospital demand. Covasim can
also be used to explore the potential impact of different interventions.


## Requirements

Python >=3.6 (64-bit). (Note: Python 2 is not supported.)

We also recommend, but do not require, using Python virtual environments. For
more information, see documentation for [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) or [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

## Quick start guide

Install with `pip install covasim[webapp]`. If everything is working, the following Python commands should bring up a plot:

```python
import covasim as cv
sim = cv.Sim()
sim.run()
sim.plot()
```

## Development setup instructions

1.  Clone a copy of the repository. If you intend to make changes to the code,
    we recommend that you fork it first.

2.  (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.

3.  Navigate to the root of the repository and install the Covasim Python package
    using one of the following options:

    *   To install with webapp support (recommended):

        `pip install -e ".[test, webapp]"`

    *   To install without webapp support:

        `pip install -e ".[test]`

    *   To install Covasim and optional dependencies (be aware this may fail
        since it relies on private packages), enter:

        `pip install -e ".[test, webapp, full]"`

    The module should then be importable via `import covasim`.


## Detailed usage

There are several examples in the `examples` directory. These can be run as
follows:

* `python examples/simple.py`

  This example creates a figure using default parameter values.

* `python examples/run_sim.py`

  This shows a slighly more detailed example, including creating an intervention and saving to disk.

* `python examples/run_scenarios.py`

  This shows a more complex example, including running an intervention scenario, plotting uncertainty, and performing a health systems analysis.


## Structure

All core model code is located in the `covasim` subfolder; standard usage is
`import covasim as cv`. The other subfolders, `cruise_ship` and `webapp`, are
also described below.

The model consists of two core classes: the `Person` class (which contains
information on health state), and the `Sim` class (which contains methods for
running, calculating results, plotting, etc.).


### covasim

The structure of the `covasim` folder is as follows:

* `base.py`: The `ParsObj` class, plus basic methods of the `BaseSim` class, and associated functions.
* `healthsystem.py`: The `HealthSystem` class, for determining hospital capacity and treatment rates.
* `interventions.py`: The `Intervention` class, for adding interventions and dynamically modifying parameters.
* `parameters.py`: Functions for creating the parameters dictionary and loading the input data.
* `people.py`: The `Person` class, and functions to create a population of people.
* `requirements.py`: A simple module to check that imports succeeded, and turn off features if they didn't.
* `run.py`: Functions for running simulations (e.g. parallel runs and scenarios).
* `sim.py`: The `Sim` class, which performs most of the heavy lifting: initializing the model, running, and plotting.
* `utils.py`: Functions for choosing random numbers, many based on Numba, plus other helper functions.
* `version.py`: Version, date, and license information.


### cruise_ship

A version of the Covasim model specifically adapted for modeling the Diamond
Princess cruise ship. It uses its own parameters file (`parameters.py`) and has
slight variations to the model (`model.py`).


### webapp

For running the interactive web application: please see the `README.md` in that
folder for more information, including information on running locally and Docker
deployment.
