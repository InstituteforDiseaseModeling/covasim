About Covasim
=============

Covasim is a stochastic agent-based simulator for performing COVID-19 analyses. These include projections of indicators such as numbers of infections and peak hospital demand. Covasim can also be used to explore the potential impact of different interventions, including social distancing, school closures, testing, contact tracing, quarantine, and vaccination.

Requirements
============

Python 3.7 or 3.8 (64-bit). (Note: Python 2.7 and Python 3.9 are not supported.)

We also recommend, but do not require, installing Covasim in a virtual environment. For more information, see documentation for e.g. Anaconda_.

.. _Anaconda: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html


Quick start guide
==================

Install with ``pip install covasim``. If everything is working, the following Python commands should bring up a plot::

  import covasim as cv
  sim = cv.Sim()
  sim.run()
  sim.plot()


Full installation instructions
==============================

If you would rather download the source code rather than using the ``pip`` package, follow these steps:

1.  Clone a copy of the repository. If you intend to make changes to the code, we recommend that you fork it first.

2.  (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.

3.  Navigate to the root of the repository and install the Covasim Python package using one of the following options:

    *   For normal installation (recommended)::

          pip install -e .

    *   To install Covasim and optional dependencies (be aware this may fail since it relies on nonstandard packages)::

          pip install -e .[full]

    The module should then be importable via ``import covasim as cv``.


Usage examples
==============

There are several examples in the ``examples`` folder. These can be run as follows:

* ``python examples/simple.py``

  This example creates a figure using default parameter values.

* ``python examples/run_sim.py``

  This shows a slightly more detailed example, including creating an intervention and saving to disk.

* ``python examples/run_scenarios.py``

  This shows a more complex example, including running an intervention scenario, plotting uncertainty, and performing a health systems analysis.

Other examples in that folder are taken from the tutorials.


Module structure
================

All core model code is located in the ``covasim`` subfolder; standard usage is ``import covasim as cv``. The ``data`` subfolder is described below.

The model consists of two core classes: the ``Person`` class (which contains information on health state), and the ``Sim`` class (which contains methods for running, calculating results, plotting, etc.).

The structure of the ``covasim`` folder is as follows, roughly in the order in which the modules are imported, building from most fundamental to most complex:

* ``version.py``: Version, date, and license information.
* ``requirements.py``: A simple module to check that imports succeeded, and turn off features if they didn't.
* ``utils.py``: Functions for choosing random numbers, many based on Numba, plus other helper functions.
* ``misc.py``: Miscellaneous helper functions.
* ``settings.py``: User-customizable options for Covasim (e.g. default font size).
* ``defaults.py``: The default colors, plots, etc. used by Covasim.
* ``parameters.py``: Functions for creating the parameters dictionary and loading the input data.
* ``plotting.py``: Plotting scripts, including Plotly graphs for the webapp (used in other Covasim classes, and hence defined first).
* ``base.py``: The ``ParsObj`` class, the fundamental class used in Covasim, plus basic methods of the ``BaseSim`` and ``BasePeople`` classes, and associated functions.
* ``people.py``: The ``People`` class, for handling updates of state for each person.
* ``population.py``: Functions for creating populations of people, including age, contacts, etc.
* ``interventions.py``: The ``Intervention`` class, for adding interventions and dynamically modifying parameters, and classes for each of the specific interventions derived from it.
* ``immunity.py``: The ``strain`` class, and functions for computing waning immunity and neutralizing antibodies.
* ``sim.py``: The ``Sim`` class, which performs most of the heavy lifting: initializing the model, running, and plotting.
* ``run.py``: Functions for running simulations (e.g. parallel runs and the ``Scenarios`` and ``MultiSim`` classes).
* ``analysis.py``: The ``Analyzers`` class (for performing analyses on the sim while it's running), the ``Fit`` class (for calculating the fit between the model and the data), the ``TransTree`` class, and other classes and functions for analyzing simulations.

The ``data`` folder within the Covasim package contains loading scripts for the epidemiological data in the root ``data`` folder, as well as data on age distributions for different countries and household sizes.



Other folders
=============

Please see the readme in each subfolder for more information.


Bin
---

This folder contains a command-line interface (CLI) version of Covasim; example usage::

  covasim --pars "{pop_size:20000, pop_infected:1, n_days:360, rand_seed:1}"

Note: the CLI is currently not compatible with Windows. You will need to add
this folder to your path to run from other folders.


Data
----

Scripts to automatically scrape data (including demographics and COVID epidemiology data),
and the data files themselves (which are not part of the repository).


Tutorials
---------

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for nine tutorials that walk you through using Covasim, from absolute basics to advanced topics such as calibration and creating custom populations.


Examples
--------

This folder contains demonstrations of simple Covasim usage, with most examples taken from the tutorials. 


Cruise ship
~~~~~~~~~~~

An early application of Covasim to the Diamond Princess cruise ship.


Calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~

Examples of how to calibrate simulations, including `Optuna`_ (also covered in the tutorial) and `Weights and Biases`_.

.. _Optuna: https://optuna.org/
.. _Weights and Biases: https://www.wandb.com/


Licenses
--------

Licensing information and legal notices.
